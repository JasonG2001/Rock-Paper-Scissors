# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Milestone 1

I have used Teachable-Machines which allows the computer to recognise the input which the user(us) gives to the camera. By giving the computer multiple images of rock, paper and scissors, the computer is able to recognise which one is being shown.
Git has been used along with Github. Git has been used to locate the required directories and create commits to files which are then pushed to the Github site. This allows others to collaborate and work on the file. By committing the modifications, we have 'checkpoints' in which the changes can be reverted if not wanted.
